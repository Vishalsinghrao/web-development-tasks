            <p>
            <h4>
                A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light and other
                electromagnetic waves, is capable of possessing enough energy to escape it.Einstein's theory of general
                relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.The
                boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. A black hole has a great effect on the fate and
                circumstances of an object crossing it, but it has no locally detectable features according to general
                relativity.In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.</h4>
